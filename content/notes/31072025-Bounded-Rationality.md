We are always working on constrained resources. Be it time, people, knowledge. It's bounded. The outcomes are heavily dependent on the use of the resources and which has to be prioritised for the outcome. If you want some rice, you can take whatever you want and do not look for options because the effort is not worth the price you are going to save. Now for a car, you are going to consider a lot of options than a rice bag, plan for it. You will plan for the money, try to obtain the knowledge needed or outsource the knowledge using a mechanic. For a project you want to deliver, you have to plan/strategize based on the outcome.

To obtain a desirable outcome, not a perfect outcome, is local maxima. To the context, I want to attain the best outcome. In a general context where you have needed resources, you can achieve the global maxima.

The goal is to attain local maxima according to your leverage.
Coming to security use case, you often face with less people resources, less time.
Less resource and less time for security reviews. You know that coverage and quality are going to take a hit.

Less resource and more time for security reviews, you can cover better than before and deliver better quality.

More resource and less time for security review, you can cover better and deliver better quality.

More resource and more time for security review, you can do the best - attain maxima.

More resource and more time is the global maxima, the perfect situation we want to be in but often the reality is not.

It is better to commit to local maxima and set expectations instead of overarching to global maxima and fail.
